    "Each row corresponds to one student and includes demographic and family background variables (e.g., basic personal and household characteristics), school-related variables (e.g., school context, study habits, past failures), behavioral and lifestyle indicators (e.g., free time, going out, alcohol use), and the grades for the three school periods, on a 0–20 scale.\n",
